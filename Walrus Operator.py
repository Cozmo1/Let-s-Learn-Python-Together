# Use Python's Error Handlers to not only stop errors from occurring.
# But you can also use Error Handlers to manipulate Python code flow
# of control. As you may notice, I used the walrus := operator to write
# less lines of code. Play around with the values within these program
# examples and call wrong indexes, and wrong strings together to force
# these exception handlers to do their work, which is to stop programs
# from crashing, and they are also used for program manipulation
# purposes to change program flow control.
