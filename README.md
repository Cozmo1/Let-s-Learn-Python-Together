# Let's-Learn-Python-Together
Learn Python Programming with me.

These Python files are meant to be explored. Some examples show possible text errors that beginners should know and understand,
to be able to identify such errors from occuring.

Please note: any Python programming examples, which are not 'mine', I will sternly give credit those of whom I've used examples from,
such as Corey Schafer and Programming with Mosh.

99% of anything else is all my very own, dedicated Python programming skills and works, which so far had taken me three years to fully start to understand
Object Oriented Programming Languages, such as Python.

However, my "Python Programmer's Glossary Bible" By Joseph C. Richardson does not and will not cotain any Python programming examples from others, unless
others want to buld onto it, knowingly first.

I Sincerely hope you will want to learn as much Python programming skills, as I, myself am still learning all about Python, Object Oriented Programming.

Joseph C. Richardson
