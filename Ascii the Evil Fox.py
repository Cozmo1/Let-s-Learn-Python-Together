'''Minute Python Program Examples'''

# Try this Bone Chilling Ascii Code Python Program Example if You Dare!

'''
This is my uncut version of this scary, spooky Python program example, which this video does not
show in it. Had I created and launched it on Halloween, I would have done such an uncut version
like this Python program example shows. However, I couldn't let December, Friday the 13'th go by
and by accident, I created one of my Minute Python videos #13 was the unlucky, but lucky enough
number, that I didn't realize what I had done, until after I launched it up on YouTube that day.

I was simply bored right out of my skull, when I created the Devil's Python program example. Mind
you, it did scare me to want to even try to think of things like this up. But sometimes, my mind takes
me to such wonderous and scary things in me, that I cannot seem to ignore them at all. Yet, having 
Asperger's, I'm often more fearful of people than I am with a Manmade God or a Manmade Devil, 
which I do not believe in such things at all. Mankind is simply both of these things inside us all.
The only thing is,  which voice within you do you want to listen to. Good, or Evil? We are BOTH.
One cannot live without the other, but the betterment of the two will always prevail as long as we
want to survive as a species as a whole.

The Devil once liveD. Don't livE Evil.
